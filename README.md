### This is a note taking application. The user will enter a note title and a description of the note, and then click the save icon in the top right corner of the screen. From there, the note that the user created is saved to the created express server. If the user clicks the delte icon on the left hand side where the saved notes are, it will delete the note from the server based off of the id that the note has in the database JSON file.
